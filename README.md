# **Sales Tracker**
Sales Tracker is a streamlined sales tracking app built for beer reps.  It makes it easy for reps to store account information and add notes.  Accounts are added one time and are simply selected from a dropdown menu when adding notes during a visit.  There is also a built in map function to make it easy for reps to remember where are accounts are located. 

## **Getting Started**

As a user:
 - By default the user is taken to the add notes page
 - To add notes simply start by selecting an account from the dropdown menu or by clicking the plus button to add an account
 - Once an account is selected, a notes form will appear where you can submit notes or view the location of the account on a map
 - If you choose to add an account an account form will populate where you can enter in the necessary information and hit submit
 - To view notes you simply click the view notes tab at the top of the page and they will populate in the order that they were submitted
